Before you upload a changed version to the main site:
1. Copy all files which are to be modified into a new folder in "/backup" title with the date.
    1a. If you are changing the entire website, you MUST backup all files and relevant folders (images, youtube, instagram, gplus, etc.)
2. If uploading to beta or media-test, it is up to you whether you want to make a backup. Also, keep in mind that anything you upload to either can be overwritten at any time by another person.
