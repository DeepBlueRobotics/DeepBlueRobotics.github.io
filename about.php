				Who We Are
			</h3>
	<p class="body-font">
		FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) Team 199, Deep Blue Robotics, is a third-year team established in August of 2015 by students at Carlmont High School to make STEM and business education accessible for Carlmont students through the avenue of FIRST. Deep
		Blue Robotics participates in FRC, the FIRST-organized robotics competition. Each year, we are handed a challenge from FIRST and have six weeks to build a robot to overcome that challenge. To learn more about FIRST and FRC, visit the FIRST website at
		<a href="http://firstinspires.org" target="_blank">firstinspires.org</a>.</br>
		</br>Team 199 consists of Carlmont students, invaluable mentors, and supportive parents. Carlmont also has a Robotics Engineering class.

				History
			</h3>
	<p class="body-font">
		Deep Blue Robotics has grown enormously as an enterprise and as a community since our foundation in 2015. Based at Carlmont High School after breaking off from FRC Team 100 at Woodside High School, we have worked hard to grow from a garage team without
		adequate shop space and tooling, staff resources, or funding, to a well-equipped team integrated into our school and local community. On the team, any Carlmont student that wishes to join and dedicate time has the opportunity to learn first-hand about
		essential technical and business skills, giving them priceless career experience and intellectually inspiring them through the potential of innovation and entrepreneurship.</br>
		</br>Our progress has been dramatic, and our organization is expanding still. Starting in the 2016 school year, the team now has an official course at Carlmont High School, entitled Engineering Robotics, which is opening a huge opportunity for technical
		and entrepreneurial training and non-rushed development of our team's priorities, optimized structure, and efforts to engage with the community. Such a quick expansion would not have been possible without the advice and dedication of our mentors, the
		financial support of our sponsors, the invaluable help of our past and present core teachers, and our school administration's kind accommodation of us.
