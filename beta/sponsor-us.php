		Our team relies on personal donations and corporate sponsors to cover our operational expenses. Unlike other teams, we do not have “team fees” that students must pay to join the team. In past years, our former team's annual expenses have been around $40,000:
		$10,000 for robot development and parts, $10,000 for competition registration, $15,000 for travel/lodging/shipping, $2,500 for tool upkeep and materials replacement, and $2,500 for public relations/outreach items and general team expenses. We expect
		our annual expenses to be similarly high. However, as this is our first year and we are starting a new team at a school that does not have a shop, we will also have to purchase tools, machines, and stock materials that other established teams do not
		have to worry about. We estimate that these additional expenses will be around $10,000. As you can see, FRC is an amazing program, however it requires some money. We rely on corporate sponsors and personal donations to fund our team and allow us to
		continue bringing STEM education to our students. Your support is always appreciated.

						Corporate sponsors gain publicity through the team in many ways. Sponsors’ names and logos are featured prominently on this website, are printed on our team t-shirts (which we wear at all competitions and outreach events), and are featured on the side
						panels of our robot itself. Sponsors are also listed with FIRST and therefore appear on all competition programs as part of our official team name which is announced at the beginning of elimination matches at competition.
