    Corporate sponsors gain publicity through the team in many ways. Sponsors’
    names and logos are featured prominently on this website, are printed on our
    team t-shirts (which we wear at all competitions and outreach events), and
    are featured on the side panels of our robot itself. Sponsors are also
    listed with FIRST and therefore appear on all competition programs as part
    of our official team name which is announced at the beginning of elimination
    matches at competition.

  title: Let's Keep STEM Going!

    Our team relies on personal donations and corporate sponsors to cover our
    operational expenses. Unlike other teams, we do not have “team fees” that
    students must pay to join the team. In past years, our former team's annual
    expenses have been around $40,000: $10,000 for robot development and parts,
    $10,000 for competition registration, $15,000 for travel/lodging/shipping,
    $2,500 for tool upkeep and materials replacement, and $2,500 for public
    relations/outreach items and general team expenses. We expect our annual
    expenses to be similarly high. However, as this is our first year and we are
    starting a new team at a school that does not have a shop, we will also have
    to purchase tools, machines, and stock materials that other established
    teams do not have to worry about. We estimate that these additional expenses
    will be around $10,000. As you can see, FRC is an amazing program, however
    it requires some money. We rely on corporate sponsors and personal donations
    to fund our team and allow us to continue bringing STEM education to our
    students. Your support is always appreciated.


    All donations, either corporate or personal, are tax-deductible.
