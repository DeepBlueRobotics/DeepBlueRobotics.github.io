This site will **eventually** be the live www.carlmontrobotics.org website.

Changes should be made to the DeepBlueRobotics/DeepBlueRobotics.github.io repository, previewed at https://DeepBlueRobotics.github.io, and then a pull request should be made to this repository. If the preview is acceptable to a mentor, the pull request should be merged and the result will be live. If a change needs to be undone, the corresponding pull request can be opened and reverted to create a new pull request with undoes it. That pull request should then be merged to undo the original pull request.
