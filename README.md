# Introduction

These are instructions for maintaining the carlmontrobotics.org website. [Making changes is easy](#making-changes-online) and can be done from any modern web browser. More advanced users can also [make changes offline](#making-changes-offline) using tools running on a MacOS or Linux machine. [Administative tasks](#administration) like managing permissions are accomplished via GitHub. If you are curious how the site works, take a look [behind the scenes](#behind-the-scenes).

To make changes to the carlmontrobotics.org website:

1. An editor makes the changes to the staging website, deepbluerobotics.github.io.
2. The editor requests that the changes be merged into the production website, carlmontrobotics.org.
3. A reviewer approves the changes and merges them into the production website, carlmontrobotics.org.

The editor and reviewer both need to have GitHub accounts. If you don't have one, just [sign up](https://github.com/join). 

Editors need to be members of the [DeepBlueRobotics organization](https://github.com/DeepBlueRobotics) with write access to at least the [DeepBlueRobotics.github.io project](https://github.com/DeepBlueRobotics/DeepBlueRobotics.github.io). The programming subteam lead or programming subteam lead mentor can add you to that organization and provide you that access if you don't have it already.

Reviewers are mentors and they need to be members of the [DeepBlueRoboticsMentors organization](https://github.com/DeepBlueRoboticsMentors) with write access to at least the [DeepBlueRoboticsMentors.github.io project](https://github.com/DeepBlueRoboticsMentors/DeepBlueRoboticsMentors.github.io). The programming subteam lead mentor can add you to that organization and provide you that access if you don't have it already.

Changes should be made to the DeepBlueRobotics/DeepBlueRobotics.github.io repository, previewed at https://DeepBlueRobotics.github.io, and then a pull request should be made to this repository. If the preview is acceptable to a mentor, the pull request should be merged and the result will be live. If a change needs to be undone, the corresponding pull request can be opened and reverted to create a new pull request with undoes it. That pull request should then be merged to undo the original pull request.
